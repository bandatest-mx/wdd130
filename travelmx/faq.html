            <h2>What's the Covid situation? </h2>
            <h5>Mexico had administered roughly 209.7 million doses of vaccine, or 165 doses per 100 people as of August 21. For comparison, the United States has administered about 185 doses per 100 people and Canada has given 234 doses per 100 people. </h5>

            <h2>Is Mexico Safe to Travel? </h2>
            <h5> The answers to the questions above are tricky, because no place on Earth is 100% safe. Beyond that, safety is a feeling not a fact; meaning we may “feel” safe, but we’re never truly safe based on any quantifiable certainty. However, from personal experience, I have felt safe during my Mexico travels.</h5>

            <h2>What can visitors expect? </h2>
            <h5>Many hotels and lodging groups offer on-site Covid-19 testing for travelers returning to places that require them. Check with your hotel about on-site testing before you travel. What are the restrictions? There is no need to take a test before departure or undertake any form of quarantine. Those concerned they might have symptoms should ask for the Sanidad Internacional health organization. Some Mexican states or cities might have tighter restrictions than the country at large based on local conditions. Tourists may want to inquire with their hotels or resorts about any local directives before committing to plans. You can also use this directory of phone numbers for individual states.</h5>
