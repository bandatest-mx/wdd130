        WHICH PART OF MEXICO DO YOU LIKE?
        From the beach to the mountains, from the desert to the jungle, from the archaeological zone to the vibrant cities, from sweet to spicy flavors, from relaxing to the happy of its parties, Mexico has everything that tourists are looking for, which is well received by the warmth of its people. Mexico has 32 states to fall in love with.
        Did you know?
        That the Cathedral of Puebla is devoted to “Nuestra Señora de la Inmaculada Concepción” (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception), and was consecrated on April 18, 1649, that is, 74 years after its construction began as a sumptuous religious site from the Viceroyalty era; with a height exceeding 70 meters and declared as a World Heritage Site, it has 14 side chapels, whose main altar is known as the Altar of the Kings.
        The UNESCO-listed city of Guanajuato is quite possibly the most picturesque place in all of Mexico. Brightly coloured buildings tumble down the hillside, leading to lovely plazas and squares.

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        What's the Covid situation?
        Mexico had administered roughly 209.7 million doses of vaccine, or 165 doses per 100 people as of August 21. For comparison, the United States has administered about 185 doses per 100 people and Canada has given 234 doses per 100 people.

        What can visitors expect?
        Many hotels and lodging groups offer on-site Covid-19 testing for travelers returning to places that require them. Check with your hotel about on-site testing before you travel.

        What are the restrictions?
        There is no need to take a test before departure or undertake any form of quarantine. Those concerned they might have symptoms should ask for the Sanidad Internacional health organization.
        Some Mexican states or cities might have tighter restrictions than the country at large based on local conditions. Tourists may want to inquire with their hotels or resorts about any local directives before committing to plans. You can also use this directory of phone numbers for individual states.
